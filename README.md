<h1>About s_(MASHED)</h1>
<p>The purpose of s_(MASHED) is to create a collaborative space for artists who deal in remixing existing images, specifically
collages. Users have the opportunity to show off the work they've made in-app and comment on other users' work. Additionally,
they can send "Collab Requests" to other users, allowing them to work one on one with each other to create something truly
smashing.</p>

<h1>Landing Page</h1>

<p>Users are greeted with a landing page that lets them read about the philosophy of s_(MASHED) and then navigate to the
Registration / Login page.</p>

<h1>Profile</h1>
<img style="height:300px; width:300px;" src="./assets/profile.gif">
<p>Users are led to their homepage where they can upload their own profile picture and cover photo, as well as write a short bio

<h1>Collage</h1>
<img style="height:300px; width:300px;" src="./assets/collage-demo1.png">
<p>Users can navigate to the collage interface through the nav-bar where they are able to upload images and rearrange them on the
canvas, applying filters or resizing and rotating them to their heart's content. After creating their collage, users have the
option to submit their collages, publishing them on their personal profile page and allowing other users to view and comment on them.
Also, if a user runs into a bit of trouble while making an image, they can toggle the public chatroom to ask a question of the
s_(MASHED) community</p>

<h1>Public Chat</h1>
<img style="height:300px; width:300px;" src="./assets/public-chat.gif">
<p>A public chatroom is available to all users and encourages them to meet other users and share their own work.</p>

<h1>Other Users' Profiles</h1>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
    <img style="height:300px; width:300px;" src="./assets/search.gif">
    <img style="height:300px; width:300px;" src="./assets/other-profiles.gif">
  </div>
 <p>Users can navigate to other users' profiles using two methods: the search bar or by clicking on their profile picture
  in the chatroom. Once there, they can request a Collab Request, if they haven't already, see their list of friends,
  or see the collages that they've created. Additionally, users are able to send one another private messages after
  accepting a collab request.</p>

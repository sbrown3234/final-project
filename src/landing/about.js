          <p>s_(MASHED) is a social networking site for the creatives, people who want to make something out of nothing -- but make it through collaboration.
          Made with the idea that the crowd can produce something great, s_(MASHED) seeks to change the way that we innovate.</p>

          <p><strong>INVITE:</strong> Involve your friends in projects that you're working on. Whether it's a story, an image, a wireframe, or whatever the fuck,
        create <i>together</i>. (Wo)Man is not an island, and you certainly don't have to be one in order to make something great. </p>

        </div>
